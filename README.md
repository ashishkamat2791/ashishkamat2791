## Hi  Welcome to DevOps World!ðŸ‘‹

I am Ashish Avinash Kamat, a Senior DevOps Engineer passionate about CI CD, Containerization, Infrastructure Automation and many more. 

```
DevOps (noun):  is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes..
```
- :computer: I code in python and bash.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SRE practices and DevOps processes.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for different ways of Infrastructure Automation, DevOps improvements.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. If I didn't know maybe I will learn something new!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I talk less. I am a fun loving person with great humor and can be good mentor.
